# Dublin Bus Tracker

A simple web-based dashboard that lets let interested parties know when the next bus will be at the desired stop.

It is composed by a `node.js` backend that talks to Dublin Bus's RTPI service and a very simple front-end that shows in how much time a given bus will be at the desired stop.
